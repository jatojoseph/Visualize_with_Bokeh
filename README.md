## Visualize_with_Bokeh
This Repo aims at getting you started with installing and using Bokeh on the fly. 

Bokeh is an interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation. Its goal is to provide elegant, concise construction of versatile graphics, and to extend this capability with high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming datasets. Bokeh can help anyone who would like to quickly and easily create interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications. As a beginner, Bokeh's simplicity has being a really great tool for visualisation and i encourage data scientist out htere to ry out Bokeh and explore its beutity and simplicity.
### Installation
Although, there are multiple ways to install Bokeh, it is recmmended to use the Anaconda Python distribution and enter this command at a Bash or Windows command prompt:

conda install bokeh 

This installs all the dependencies that Bokeh needs. Anaconda minimizes installation effort on all platforms and configurations, including Windows, and also installs the examples into the examples/ subdirectory of your Anaconda or Miniconda installation directory.

If you are confident that you have installed all needed dependencies, such as NumPy, you may instead use pip at the command line:

pip install bokeh

Checkout the Officail homepage @ https://bokeh.pydata.org for more options and guide.

Cheers!
